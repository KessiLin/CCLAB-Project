        This is a song of loneliness. <br>
        The narrator tells his story of a failed relationship. <br>
        The vibe is shadow especially it is a song called Christmas Eve. <br>
        The lyrics are straightforward but very descriptive.
      </p>
      <p class="linespace" id="yellow">
        I inserted some relative images, <br>
        modified texts' colors and spacing, <br>
        and centered the whole lyrics, <br>
        so that the audience could feel the feelings of loneliness and vanishing relationships that the lyrics describe.
